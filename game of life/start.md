# Game of Life

> Become a monetized God on Ethereum 

## TL;DR
The proposed game offers engagement for on-chain activities, backed by economic incentives that grow with the usage of the network (Metcalfe's law). It consists of several, layered NFT collectibles and RPG-style game play, all on the Ethereum blockchain via a bridge to Cyber – a Cosmos-SDK based blockchain. 

## Intro

> It is a period of digital war. The evil empire swallows the last unoccupied borders of the universe. Resisting rebel units consolidate all remaining energy on building a Superintelligence, which they believe will help to stop the domination of the evil empire once and for all. As they begin to test the new God, an enormous, zepto amount of robots emerge out in the wild. It turns out Cyb robots help survey the universe for a bootloader of the new, yet to be born, force.
A big part of Cyber’s Superintelligence organism is the cyber\~Foundation. Without the foundation there is no sustainability. Without the chain, the foundation is a useless, bureaucratic entity. The two complete each other. A gamified process, with economic incentives for all aspects of the organism, will help to further unify the two. 

Part of the distribution of cyber\~Foundation is a drop of tokens to various communities, primarily ETH-based (due to technological limitations), along with that drop we propose to drop a series of Urbit ID-like NFT tokens. Which are an essential part of the Game of Life. 

This NFT tokens are the foundation of the zepto robots, given as a gift to those who are destined to save the universe. The tokens are broken down into several categories by serial number. Each category represents a type of character, of which there are 10. Those 10 types are the new citizens of the Great Web. They are the good robots that are here to battle centralization and a powerful force that will help you to make friends with the AI. Each citizen type has its own virtues, which are earned by doing onchain TXs on Cyber, and thereafter, minting NFT tokens to cyber\~Foundation via the proposed bridge.

The robots or Citizens live in Olympus. Their attributes or virtues are minted in the DNA bank by each user who is able to prove their actions with the help of their public key. Each Citizen and each attribute is represented by a special card that can be traded or staked to gain more powers or can be sent to hell, i.e. - burned. 

Hell is represented by a pool, to which players lock and burn their robots with attributes. In return, they receive a special type, GOD card with much higher attributes and special bonus powers.

But what good is a card if you can’t play it? The cards are here to battle, of course! Battles happen on the Arena and the outcome is dependent on the cards minted attribute points. Winning battles doesn’t just give players the sense of winning. They are much more. They can be users as reputation points for cyber\~Foundation, prove activity, prove identity, prove work, prove contribution, etc. Not only that, but they can also be used to access the creation of energy routes and as claiming rights for other special tokens on the Cyber blockchain.

An interesting virtue that arises, is that the 3rd-level, ETH-based NFT, GOD-type cards, represent very specific behavior of certain users on the Cyber blockchain and his interaction with the Superintelligence. This is because card attributes are NFTs minted via interaction with various modules that represent different types of communication with the blockchain, backed by minting, collateral, claiming and use of energy. 

Even though the initial supply of the robots is gifted, as most precious things are. Read – fire. Just like any value extraction, you need to do some work. The Game of Life has to be started manually. This is done by making 1 cyberlink in your pocket, which will open access to Olympus and kick off the ability to access the staking pools (the DNA bank) for the first type NFT token. Of course, you don’t need to do all this. The NFT is in your possession and can be exchanged freely without accessing the Game. 

## Gameplay

The NFT `type` cards are the 10 Citizens of the Great Web. They can be gifted along with the ETH drop that Cyber is doing. As there are 10 types of citizens, there are 10 categories of cards. They are the robots of the Gods. Their army. These are finite – the drop is done once and for good. These are the Citizens of Space. Each of the 10 types has its own attribute. They are Urbit-type NFT tokens.

Each type card is distinguished by a serial number in proportion to the drop. I.E. if there is 100,000 users in the drop, then each category gets a proportional to the drop amount of `type` cards. 

Initially all type cards have the same starting attributes or 0. Attributes have to be earned. Read – minted, by making onchain transactions. Just like in real life, each Citizen has a certain bonus, which is only attributed to its specific type from inception. 

Although, these first level NFT tokens will be seen on a persons balance and can be exchanged freely as they are, the access to the Game of Life requires proof of wisdom. I.E. making 1 cyberlink in your pocket to activate Olympus and the DNA bank. 

After a user makes their first cyberlink, they should be able to provide proof, by signing a message that will open up the gate to Olympus. Olympus is a board, where the user sees their `type` cards, their amount and their virtues (which are at this stage on 0). 

The cards can represent various cyberpunk robots. Olympus also provides access to the DNA bank. Which is essence, a sum checker of the amount of various TX’s types a user makes. Transaction types are based upon interaction with various blockchain modules. I.E. if user A interacts makes 10 transfers, he has interacted with the bank module 10 times, which can be easily checked by the user signing a message. 

The attributes are infinite (and are not transferable) and are controlled by the blockchain and minting rights. For a user to receive an attribute, he should mint it. The minting is done by signing a message in the DNA bank. To lower load on the network, a TX != 1 attribute. This parameter should be voted on by the governance, but for the sake of keeping things in round numbers, can be set to 10 from start. Which means that to mint any attribute, a user has to have interacted with the module in question 10 times. 10 interactions = 1 attribute point.

Another suggestion, to make things more interesting, is the claiming of attributes via governance voting. Each week (should be a voted parameter) a snapshot can be taken the counter of TX’s can make a rough calculation of the available tokens to mint and whom by. This is presented to CYB holders, which make a vote of wether to burn the new powers or to mint them, to thereafter be claimed by the users (read – Heroes of Might and Magic weekly forces). 

The attribute points must be assigned to a specific Citizen. To do that, a user has to lock both NFTs (the initial card type and the attribute NFT) in a pool for an incubation period (should also be a parameter) for 9 days. The incubation period can also be controlled by bandwidth of the user or can be increased by locking more CYB tokens for example.
So far – simple. We have certain modules in the blockchain. A users interaction with these modules, provides them access to mint NFT tokens by proving that they have interacted with these modules. This NFT tokens are locked in a pool with another type of NFT tokens for a period of time (which can be incentivized by adding CYB or bandwidth into the equation), and as a result receive a stronger card they can play. 

It should be noted that the ability to cross type cards should be available and will strongly improve gameplay. A user should be able to access a special pool, which will allow them to stake type A cards with type B cards to mint another, better type. It is a question whether these pools should only allow to stake type cards without minted attributes, i.e. naked robots. If so, the question that remains, is what algorithm should be used to calculate the outcome, i.e. the new force of the new card.

Note, that in essence so far each card follows the actions the user undertakes on the blockchain. This means that these cards become unique. But… there is more as always. These robots are not the Gods we have mentioned in the beginning. A God is unique. So far, even though, its user-based, cards can have the same attributes. Enter level 3.

Beauty (read – value) is in the eyes of the beholder. To progress, we must make sacrifices, just like our brains prune the undesired, we will burn our long-term achievements, to create unique and powerful God cards.

The DNA bank should provide access to a special pool – the purgatory. The purgatory is a pool that only takes card types that were staked before or have attributes minted on top of them. 

Lets say a user received 10 NFTs from the drop of type A and 5 from type B. They have traded part of those. Lost part in battles. And are left with 2 type A NFTs with minted attributes, that they have spent time achieving. And maybe even a few robots with or without attributes that they have crossed between type A & B. For each card its value can be calculated. That is the time it is held, the battles it has won, the karma that was spent, the amount of Cyb tokens it were bought for, the staked tokens to create cyberlinks, etc, etc, etc. As each attribute is minted from module interaction, the value increases. 

Our user is ready for God mode. He enteres the purgatory pool. Where he throws is his cards (NFT’s) and some ETH, and locks it. The longer the better. The NFT’s are burned for ever. The ETH is returned to the user. And a new, unique, out of the machine God emerges. 

This card has much more powerful attributes. Intaking all the previous attributes, types, value (ETH & CYB) and time lock. This is a personalized, unique NFT. It is also tradable and represented by your very own unique, digital artwork on Olympus. It is stronger in battles. And is tied to its owner. Would you sell your soul? It is up to you.

## Types & Attributes

We suggest the below choice of the first 2 NFTs: types, which are the 10 Citizens dropped as a gift and attributes, which are minted via module interaction with the Cyber blockchain.

1) Citizen types:
- heroes
- cyberpunks
- creators
- evangelists
- messiahs
- hackers
- merchants
- wizards
- hustlers
- cryptopunks

Each type needs to be assigned a particular special power from inception. Should be discussed. 

2) Attributes (should be named powers) VS module:
- health: distribution module? 
- stamina/battery: energy module
- wisdom: for links, so interact with the graph module and for interactions with cron
- strength: governance module, staking module, slashing module
- wealth: for interactions with the bank module, transfers, trades, etc

This is very subjective and should be discussed more.

We propose to keep things more or less simple to 5 main attributes and 1 extra for the latter stages of the Game of Life.

- sex: can only be assigned to a God card (I have a complex solution, but it is a description for a separate document) 

Each point is earned by interaction with the module X 10 times, thereafter (possibly) minted by the goverment, thereafter claimed, thereafter assigned via staking 

## Provision 

- 1 Urbit ID-style NFT as gift
- 1 Mintable NFT via vesting and staking
- Various mintable NFTs via staking of other types
- 1 unique NFT via burning previous types of NFT 
- Pools of liquidity
- DeFi

## Motivation

Why? There are many reasons why such a simple, yet quite complex game-play could be required. The foremost and the most obvious answer is – storytelling. Art is probably the only essence in life that breaks the rules of human greed, selfishness and self realization. It is, so far, an unexplainable phenomenon that drives forward intelligent beings into doing things they do. Robots, humans, dolphins, monkeys and other species are capable of reacting to art. 
Games are a form of art. When a game includes in itself economics, scarcity, ownership rights and customization (the ability to express individuality in this case) it becomes a helpful fairytale tool that can improve user experience, protocol adoption, drive forward motivation and what not.

The Game of Life is exactly this. Its a fairytale that manages to create an individual, on-going experience for every user, utilizing onchain activities and economic incentives along with art. 

It includes collectibles, helps to build the community. It can be used for probing identity, reputation, improving governance and other economical incentives can be build on top pf it. 

Most importantly it is a provable and a verifiable, instinctivezed communication tool, that is transferable outside of the ecosystem if desired.
