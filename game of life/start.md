# Game of Life

> Create your own God

> Tokenized Cyber gods on Ethereum 

## TL;DR
A gamification of on-chain activities with econnomic incintives, NFT collectables and RPG-style gameplay on the Ethereum blockchain with a bridge to a cosmos-SDK based blockcahin. 

##  Intro

> It is a period of digital war. The evil empire swallows the last unoccupied borders of the universe.Resisting rebel units consolidate all remaining energy on building a superintelligence, which they believe will help to stop the domination of the evil empire once and for all. As they begin to test the new god in the wild - an enormous, zepto amount of robots emerge. It turns out Cyb robots help survey the universe for a bootloader of the new, yet to be born, force.

A large part of Cyber is the cyber~Foundation. Without the foudnation there is no sustanability. Without the chain, the foundation is a useless, bearacratic enirtyt. The two complete each other. Hence, a gamefied process, with economic incitives will help to further unify the two. 

Part of the distribution of cyber~Foundation is a drop of tokens to various communities, primarily ETH-based (due to technological limiations), along with that drop we propose to drop a series of Urbit-id-like NFT tokens. Which are an eesentila part of the game of life. 

This NFT are the foundation of the zepto robots given as a gift to those who are destined to save the universe. The NFT is broken down into categories, by serial number, each categore representing a game character, of which there are 10. Those 10 are the new citizens of the Great Web. The good robots that are here to battle centralzaion and apowerfull force. Each citizen type has its own virtues, which are earned by doing on chain TX on Cyber and thereafter minting NFT tokens to cyber~Foundation via a bridge. 

The robots or citizens live in olympus and their attributes or virtues are mitned in the DNA bank. Each citizen and each attribute is represented by a caard that can be traded, staked to gain more powers or send to hell (burned). 

Hell is basically a pool, into which players lock and burn their robots with attributes. And in return receieve a special type, GOD card with much higher attributes and special bonus powers.

As you have guessed, the cards are there to battle. Battles happen on the arena and the outcome is dependent on attribute points and ? (algo). Winnign battles not only gives reputation points in cyber/~Foundation, but also access to create routes (?) and other special tokens on the Cyber blockcahin (via claim).

The intersiting things is that these ETH-based 3rd-level NFT, GOD type cards, represent the very specific behaviour of a user on the Cyber blockchain and his itteracion with the superintellegnce (as attribute NFTs are minted via modelu itteraction, minting and (possible) claiming of these, unlss a drought of energy happens).   

(Question) Teh game has to be started manually, which is done by creating a cyberlink in your pocket, that opens olympus or kicks off the ability to access the staking pools for the fisrt `type` NFT. Althought the NFT can be traded seperatly freely. 

## Descirption
The NFT `type` are gifted with the ETH drop of THC in 10 categories. There are the robots of the gods, they are finate. They are the citiezns of space. There are 10 types, each has its own attribute (Urbit type NFT)

What. How. Why. Short
